# LLM Behavioral Shift

🚀 **Investigating Behavioral Self-Awareness and Persona Shifts in Fine-Tuned LLMs**  

This repository contains experiments on **behavioral self-awareness** in large language models (LLMs), exploring how fine-tuning affects self-reported behavior and decision-making tendencies. The project is inspired by Betley et al. (2025) and builds upon prior work on **out-of-context reasoning (OOCR)**.
